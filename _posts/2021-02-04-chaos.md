Chaos theory is a study about randomness and unpredictable behavior in a system that obeys deterministic laws, meaning that a particular initial condition always evolves in the same way. Chaos theory state that a small change in the initial conditions may lead to drastically different behavior. This is also known as the butterfly effect introduced by Edward Lorenz from the idea that the mere flapping of a butterfly’s wing can cause a hurricane several weeks later.

Edward Lorenz was a mathematician and meteorologist who combined the two disciplines to create chaos theory. During the 1950s, Edward Lorenz searched for a means of forecasting the weather. In an experiment to model a weather prediction, he makes the initial conditions to be 0.506, instead of 0.506127. The result was a different prediction. From this, he concluded that the weather must change on a dime. A small change in the initial conditions has immense long-term implications. It shows that even detailed atmospheric modeling cannot make precise long-term weather predictions because we never know the initial conditions precisely enough to accurately predict the weather after a certain point in time. That tiny decimal difference is enough to produce extremely inaccurate predictions in the long run.

# Conditions for Chaos
There are three required mathematical properties for a system to be classified as chaotic:
1. Sensitivity to initial conditions
1. Topological mixing
1. Density of periodic orbits

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the butterfly effect. Edward Lorenz developed a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection. The model is a system of three ordinary differential equations known as the Lorenz equations:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma(y-x)
$$

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = x(\rho-z) - y
$$

$$
\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - \beta z
$$

With:
1. x as the rate of convection
1. y as horizontal temperature variation
1. z as vertical temperature variation
1. sigma, rho, and beta are system constant parameters

The above graph used the Lorenz equation. The initial conditions for x and z were kept the same but those for y were changed between 1.001, 1.0001, and 1.00001. The values for rho, sigma, and beta were 45.92, 16, and 4 respectively.

As we can see from the graph, even the slightest difference in initial values of y causes significant changes after about 12 iterations in the three cases. This is an example of sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Systems that are sensitive to initial conditions are said to be chaotic but being only sensitive dependence on initial conditions is not enough. Consider a system generated by the map x → 1.5x.

With initial x = 0.2 and initial x =0.21. Notice that after several iterations the red and blue lines started to move on their own. This system is sensitive to initial conditions, but it is not chaotic. Since the system multiplies x by 1.5, any small difference between starting points is magnified by a factor of 1.5 at each iteration. Regardless of the starting condition, every starting condition will eventually approach positive or negative infinity, so the asymptotic behavior given a set of initial conditions is very predictable.

Topological mixing means it will evolve in the same region for a certain period of time, then eventually intersect with any other given region.

The above graph shows six iterations of a set of states x and y passed through the logistic map. Light blue (first iteration) indicates the initial condition, which forms a circle. It can be seen that mixing occurs as time progresses. Dark blue (sixth iteration) shows that the points are almost completely scattered in the phase space.
