  abstract={Heart failure is a disease many consider to be the number one global cause of death. Despite its mortality, heart failure is still underdiagnosed clinically, especially in a remote area that experiences cardiologists shortage. Existing studies have employed artificial intelligence to help with heart failure screening and diagnosis processes based on echocardiography videos. Specifically, most existing studies use a convolutional neural network that only captures the local context of an image hindering it from learning the global context of an image. Moreover, the frame sampling algorithms only sample certain consecutive frames which makes it questionable whether the dynamic of the left ventricle during a cardiac cycle is included. This study proposed a novel deep learning model consisting of a time-distributed vision transformer stacked with a transformer. The time-distributed vision transformer learns the spatial feature and then feeds the result to the transformer to learn the temporal feature and make the final prediction afterward. We also proposed a frame sampling algorithm by squeezing the video and sampling the frame after a certain interval. Consequently, the video still contains the sequential information up until the end of the video with some in-between frames removed by a certain interval. Thus, the dynamic of the left ventricle is preserved. Our proposed method achieved an F1 score of 95.81%, 96.19%, and 93.43% for the apical four chamber view, apical two chamber view, and parasternal long axis view respectively. The overall trustworthiness of our model is quantified using the NetTrustScore and achieved a score of 0.9712, 0.9767, and 0.9527 for the apical four chamber view, apical two chamber view, and parasternal long axis view respectively.},

  abstract={Fast and accurate post-earthquake building damage assessment is an important task to do to define search and rescue procedures. Many approaches have been proposed to automate this process by using artificial intelligence, some of which use handcrafted features that are considered inefficient. This research proposed end-to-end building damage assessment based on a Siamese neural network. We modify the network by adding a feature concatenation mechanism to enrich the data feature. This concatenation mechanism creates different features based on each output from the convolution block. It concatenates them into a high-dimensional vector so that the feature representation is more likely to be linearly separable, resulting in better discrimination capability than the standard siamese. Our model was evaluated through three experimental scenarios where we performed classification of G1 or G5, G1-G4 or G5, and all the five grades of EMS-98 building damage description. Our models are superior to the standard Siamese neural network and state-of-the-art in this field. Our model obtains f1-scores of 79.47%, 54.09%, 40.64% and accuracy scores of 87.24%, 95.28%, and 42.57% for the first, second, and third experiments, respectively.},

  title={Change Detection of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Through Adaptive Focal Modulation on Hierarchical Feature Maps}, 
  year={2023},
  month={July},
  volume={11},
  abstract={One of the major challenges in the change detection (CD) of high-resolution remote sensing images is the high requirement for computational resources. Besides, to get the best change detection result, it must spot only the important changes while omitting unimportant ones, which requires learning complex interactions between multi-scale objects on the images. Despite Convolution Neural Network (CNN) efficiently extracting features from such images, it has a limited receptive field resulting in sub-optimal representation. On the other hand, Vision Transformer (ViT) can capture long-range dependencies. Still, it suffers from quadratic complexity concerning the number of image patches, especially for high-resolution images. Furthermore, both approach can not model the interactions among multi-scale image patches, which is essential for a model to fully understand the natural images. We propose FocalCD, a CD method based on a recently proposed focal modulation architecture capable of learning short and long dependencies to solve this problem. It is attention-free and does not suffer from quadratic complexity. Also, it supports learning multi-scale interaction by adaptively selecting the discriminator regions from multi-scale levels. Besides the efficient yet powerful encoder, FocalCD has an effective multi-scale feature fusion and pyramidal decoder network. FocalCD achieves strong empirical results on various CD datasets, including CDD, LEVIR-CD, and WHU-CD. It reaches F1 scores of 0.9851, 0.952, and 0.9616 on datasets CDD, LEVIR-CD, and WHU-CD outperforming state-of-the-art CD methods while having comparable or even lower computation complexity.},

  abstract={An accurate assessment of heart function is crucial in diagnosing the cardiovascular disease. One way to evaluate or detect the disease can use echocardiography, by detecting systolic and diastolic volumes. However, manual human assessments can be time-consuming and error-prone due to the low resolution of the image. One way to detect heart failure on echocardiogram is by segmenting the left ventricle on the echocardiogram using deep learning. In this study, we modified the MultiResUNet model for left ventricle segmentation in echocardiography images by adding Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling block and Attention block. The use of multires blocks from MultiResUnet is able to overcome the problem of multi-resolution segmentation objects, where the segmentation objects have different sizes. This problem has similar characteristics to echocardiographic images, where the systole and diastole segmentation objects have different sizes from each other. Performance measure were evaluated using Echonet-Dynamic dataset. The proposed model achieves dice coefficient of 92%, giving an additional 2% performance result compared to the MultiResUNet.},

  abstract={Evaluation of buildings is crucial to aid emergency response but it costs a lot of resources to do it manually. Many approaches have been proposed to automate the process using artificial intelligence. Most of them, use handcrafted feature, difference calculation between pre-disaster and post-disaster feature, and a classifier model separately. In this study, the process from feature extraction, feature difference and classification are represented by a single model which is siamese neural network. Furthermore, we modify siamese neural network by implementing residual connection for feature concatenation purposes. We evaluate our model on Kumamoto Prefecture earthquake LiDAR data. The result shows the modified model is able to outperform the baseline model with Accuracy and F-measure of 90.91% and 79.28% respectively.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
