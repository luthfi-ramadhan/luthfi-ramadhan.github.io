I am a dedicated researcher in machine learning and deep learning with over four years of experience. I specialize in pattern recognition, computer vision, and the development of cutting-edge algorithms. 

Currently, I am a Researcher at Universitas Indonesia, where I contribute to groundbreaking projects in the Intelligent Robots and Systems (IRoS) laboratory. My work includes developing deep learning models like CNNs, LSTMs, Siamese networks, and Vision Transformers, and achieving significant outcomes in medical imaging and remote sensing fields. I am also a Lecturer Assistant, guiding students in advanced machine learning and research methodology.

<!-- # Academic and Technical Foundation -->
I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Universitas Indonesia (UI), graduating with a GPA of 3.80. I received my Bachelor's degree from Universitas Sriwijaya (UNSRI) and an exchange program at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). As a researcher, I primarily work with Python and its libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn.

<!-- # Research and Publications -->
My research contributions include authoring several research articles in esteemed journals such as IEEE Access and Actamedica Indonesiana. Topics of focus range from biomedical and remote sensing.

<!-- # Passions and Future Aspirations
Beyond my professional commitments, I am the Chief Editor of Intuition, a Medium-based publication that empowers writers in the scientific community. My passion lies in demystifying complex technologies and encouraging knowledge sharing.
Looking forward, I aspire to deepen my impact on AI-driven healthcare solutions and further explore innovations in environmental monitoring through AI. I remain committed to continuous learning and contributing to projects that drive meaningful change. -->
